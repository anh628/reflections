When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would use a remote repository when collabing with other people and if I am using different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  You control what to save online. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Fork: when you want to work on a project that someone else create/started. This way it gives credit to the original user.

  Clone: create a duplicate of the repo with all the commits up to that point.

  Branches: same repo but you want to have it seperate from the master (allows for experimenting)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  It's always good to have a backup.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
  In person. Git / GitHub would be easier as you don't have to be in the same place but sometimes it is just easier to work together in person.
