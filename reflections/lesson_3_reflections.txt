When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would use a remote repository when collaborating with other people and if I am using different computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  You control what to save online. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  Fork: when you want to work on a project that someone else create/started. This way it gives credit to the original user.

  Clone: create a duplicate of the repo with all the commits up to that point.

  Branches: same repo but you want to have it separate from the master (allows for experimenting)

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
  It's always good to have a backup.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
  In person. Git / GitHub would be easier as you don't have to be in the same place but sometimes it is just easier to work together in person. Git/GitHub have more records of who is doing what.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
  Directly in master: Working by yourself, with all changes being relatively clear and essential. Benefit is that you can avoid the overhead of managing branches and merging. Cost is that if you break something, the whole system is broken.
  Separate branches: Allows for collaboration in which different people work on different things. Benefits: Don't have to worry about breaking the system for everyone else. Can work on multiple features and bug-fixes at once. 
  Cost: More overhead, merging headaches, etc.
